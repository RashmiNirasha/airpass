# ✈️ **Airline Data Analysis - Jupyter Notebook**

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** focused on analyzing and visualizing airline passenger data. The analysis provides insights into passenger satisfaction levels, gender distribution, class preferences, and travel types using Python libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `gridspec`.

## 📊 **Features**

- ### 🎯 **Target Distribution Analysis**
  - Satisfaction levels displayed as: **Satisfied**, **Neutral**, and **Not Satisfied**.
  - Visual representations using count plots and pie charts.

- ### 🧭 **Passenger Distribution Insights**
  - **Gender Distribution:** *Male*, *Female*
  - **Class Distribution:** *Economy*, *Business*, etc.
  - **Type of Travel:** *Business Travel*, *Personal Travel*, etc.

- 🎨 Customizable color palettes and annotations for clear, informative visualizations.
- 🏷️ Enhanced x-axis labels for better interpretability.
